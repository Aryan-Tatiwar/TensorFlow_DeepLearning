# TensorFlow Deep Learning 🚀

This repository contains my learning progress, notes, and code implementations while following the **TensorFlow Crash Course** by **Zero To Mastery** on YouTube.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in **Deep Learning using TensorFlow and Keras**, starting from the basics and moving towards practical neural network implementations.
